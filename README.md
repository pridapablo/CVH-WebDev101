# CVH-WebDev101

Welcome to my `CVH-WebDev101` repository! This monorepo contains two distinct HTML web page projects that were developed as my first introduction to web development. These projects were created for the high school Technology course at Colegio Vista Hermosa, with Laura Lilia Flores Moreno as the instructor.

## Monorepo Structure

This repository is organized as a monorepo, meaning it houses the following two projects in separate directories:

### Clapton Project
Located in the `Clapton` directory, this project represents one of my web development assignments.

- Path: `Clapton/index.html`

### Rocketbook Project
Located in the `Rocketbook` directory, this project showcases another aspect of my web development learning.

- Path: `Rocketbook/index.html`

## Technology Stack

- HTML

## Setup

To view these web pages, clone my repository, navigate to the project directory of your choice, and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pridapablo/CVH-WebDev101.git
# Navigate to the Clapton project
cd CVH-WebDev101/Clapton
open index.html # Use the appropriate command based on your operating system

# Or navigate to the Rocketbook project
cd ../Rocketbook
open index.html # Use the appropriate command based on your operating system
```

## Contributions

As this is a project for a high school course, I am not actively seeking external contributions. However, feedback and suggestions from fellow students and educators are always welcome.
